# Summary of the Project: Bright Coffee shop

 The business has recently appointed a new CEO with the vision of improving the overall performance of its three coffee shop located in 3 different areas.
 To support informed decision-making and drive strategic growth, I was tasked as the Data Analyst to review historical operational and sales data.

Using SQL, I extracted and analyzed data from the business systems, and used Excel for data visualization and trend analysis. The full workflow and planning process were mapped in Miro, and the final insights have been compiled into a PowerPoint presentation.

The objective of this analysis is to:

Assess current performance across all three stores in their respective locations

Identify strengths, weaknesses, and key opportunities for improvement

Provide data-driven recommendations that will help the CEO guide the business to its next stage of growth


This insight package highlights actionable findings on customer trends, product performance, store profitability, and operational effectiveness, and concludes with strategic suggestions to enhance revenue, reduce inefficiencies, and improve competitiveness in the coffee shop market.
